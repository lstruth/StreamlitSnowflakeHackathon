## Mini App for the Streamlit Snowflake Hackathon: EconGPT: Chat with your favorite economist!
Have you ever wondered about how different schools of thought in the field of economics view the development of key economic indicators?
Do you ask yourself whether today's economic policy rather follows the famous macroeconomist John Keynes' ideas or still is in line with who is sometimes referred to as the father of economics Adam Smith?

What would they have said about the role of the government during a global pandemic, would their opinions differ on the reasons for today's inflation? 

In this mini-app you can have a detailed look at the development of some key macroeconomic indicators over the last decades in the US and can ask your favorite economists (or rather "ask" their ChatGPT spirits) about potential reasons, economic explanations or policy advice (or anything else you want).

This repository contains the code corresponding to the project.
